# Othello in Python
## How to Play
Two players take turns placing their pieces on an 8x8 game board. At the start, 4 pieces are placed in the middle of the board. Each piece that
is placed by a player must be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from one of their existing pieces, and must have at least one
of their opponents pieces between them.

When a piece has been placed, all the opponents pieces that were between the new piece and any of the player's existing pieces will flip to the
player's color. This will conclude their turn. This will go back and forth. If one player has no more valid moves to make, they forfeit their
turn. If no player has any valid moves, the game is over and thus, a winner will be crowned.


## Description
This is Othello in Python using the Pygame library. My very first real project using Python and, subsequently, my first README! My motivation for
making this was to develop my knowledge in python as well as practice OOP. This became a valuable skill to practice as I added more and more 
features to this program that caused me to change large chunks of my code. Although this originally started as a school assignment, I'm 
incredibly happy to have made it my own using the pygame library and hope to continue tinkering with it over time to add more features.
